“升起吧，美丽的太阳，去消灭那妒忌的月亮。”

“你的老师，乃是魔术之敌。”

奥勒留-马尔克斯·马洛驻足看向声音的源头，他的视线越过成排的艺术真迹，与之相称精妙浮雕装点着一段寻常走道，走道的尽头站着他的同窗，露维雅洁莉塔，衣着考究的北欧名门。

他对上她淡漠的视线，等待她的下文。

“你的老师，乃是人之大敌。”

马洛举起双手作投降状。这两句没头没尾的话叫他没耐心接着听下去，况且，再过三分钟就要迟到了。“英雄所见略同啊。”他说。

哪知少女闻言却是变色，她的手上骤然亮起魔力的光辉，神秘之力经由魔力回路引导，注入手臂内的魔力刻印，大气一同被扰动，渐强的嗡鸣声叫他心烦意乱，汗毛倒竖。

他还没适应种种超脱日常的体验。不过老师教过他，历史悠久的魔术名门的研究，通常以魔力刻印的形式代代相传、这种刻印规定了魔力的流动，从而产生不一而足的魔术效应。每代家主的毕生心血，都以刻印的形式封装起来，仅需注入魔力就能启动，重量轻过纸张，却又重于山峦。

魔术，以神秘为力量，以保密为准则，魔术的核心——此地，时钟塔，乃至整个魔术界，遵循着第一原则，“神秘应当隐匿”，而缺乏此外的道德，更没有所谓法律。历史悠久的魔术名门，也是百战百胜的角斗士，而魔术正是其手中最锋利的剑。是故，艾德菲尔特家家主，露维雅洁莉塔·艾德菲尔特手中握着的绝非裁纸小刀。

况且，裁纸刀难道不能用来杀人？切勿被这称呼所误导，魔术，近乎奇迹的术法，不是街头卖艺所用的伎俩，而是切实的捷径——由因及果的捷径。人力无法做到的事称为奇迹，此外皆在魔术的范畴。自魔术王所罗门死去已有近三千年，残酷斗争中活下来的魔术师们，没有易与之辈。

今日之冲突充其量是斗嘴，然而，若不做些什么，昔日同窗恐怕不介意伦敦城郊多一处野冢。世界的另一侧，真当是危机四伏。

这些思想浮上心头不过片刻功夫，见被轻视的贵族少女愈发愠怒。

“然而若说我完全认同，那也是说谎。”

少女所擅长的乃是“咒弹”，寻常用来也不过叫人生一场病，然而经由她的魔术刻印，则可叫人心脏骤停，当场死亡。

“还有什么遗言？”

少年顿了顿。

“他并非人之敌，只是贵族之敌罢了。”

风停了刹那，艾德菲尔特松开手：“那就足矣。”她以单调步伐款款走来，不过十余米距离，很快来到奥勒留-马尔克斯面前，指尖距他额头不过几分。

“那你呢？”

“而我认为，他并不正确。”

少女周遭的空气陡然一沉，大气中的魔力，加上她自身所有的小源魔力，供不应求，正被某个术式挥霍着。她抬起眼眸，正咀嚼这句话的真假。

香水味惹得他鼻头有些痒，马洛干脆抬起右手，“这是证据。”

他的小指指尖，微弱的魔力流动着，被限制在短短数厘间。这正是他所刻下的，马洛家魔术回路的开端。

艾德菲尔特握住他的小指，出神地看了许久，终于，她意识到自己失态，甩开他的手扬长而去。

马洛听到身后传来她的话语：“勿忘第一原则。”

假如神秘为人所知——为世人皆知，就不再能被称之为神秘，神秘也将失去力量。是故，神秘应当隐匿。而他的老师，现代魔术科学部长艾伦·纽厄尔，魔术计算学的开创者，似乎正违背这一原则。

此时是1992年7月15日。

"Arise, beautiful sun, and obliterate that jealous moon."

"Your teacher is an enemy of magecraft."

Aurelius-Markus Marlowe paused and looked towards the source of the voice. His gaze swept over a row of exquisite artworks, complemented by intricate reliefs adorning an ordinary corridor. At the end of the corridor stood his classmate, Luvia Edelfelt, a well-dressed noblewoman from Northern Europe.

He met her indifferent gaze, waiting for her to continue.

"Your teacher is a great enemy of humanity."

Marlowe raised his hands in a surrender gesture. The two disjointed statements left him impatient to hear more, especially as he was about to be late in three minutes. "Great minds think alike," he said.

However, the girl's expression changed drastically. Magic light suddenly flared up in her hand as mysterious power flowed through her magecraft circuits and into the magical engraving in her arm. The atmosphere was disturbed, and the growing hum made him restless, his hairs standing on end.

He hadn't yet adjusted to these otherworldly experiences. However, his teacher had taught him that the research of long-standing magecraft families is often passed down in the form of magical engravings. These engravings regulate the flow of magic, producing various magecraft effects. The life’s work of each generation’s head is encapsulated in these engravings, which, though lighter than paper, are heavier than mountains.

Magecraft, relying on mystery as its power and secrecy as its principle, adheres to the fundamental rule here at the Clock Tower and throughout the magecraft world: "Mystery must be concealed." There are no other moral standards, nor any so-called laws. Historic magecraft families are like undefeated gladiators, and magecraft is their sharpest sword. Therefore, the head of the Edelfelt family, Luvia Edelfelt, wields something far beyond a mere paper cutter.

Moreover, isn't a paper cutter capable of murder? Don’t be misled by the name; magecraft, nearly miraculous, is not mere street performance tricks but a practical shortcut—a shortcut from cause to effect. What humans cannot achieve is called a miracle; everything else falls within the realm of magecraft. Since the death of the Mage King Solomon nearly three thousand years ago, the surviving magicians from brutal struggles are no easy adversaries.

Today's conflict is, at most, a war of words, but if nothing is done, the former classmate would probably not mind adding another unmarked grave on the outskirts of London. The other side of the world is indeed fraught with danger.

These thoughts crossed his mind in a moment, and he saw the aristocratic girl growing more enraged.

"However, if I said I fully agreed, that would be a lie."

The magecraft Luvia excels at is "curse bullets." Normally, they might only make someone ill, but through her magical engraving, they can cause instantaneous heart failure and death.

"Do you have any final words?"

The young man paused.

"He is not an enemy of humanity, just an enemy of the nobility."

The wind stopped for a moment, and Edelfelt released her grip. "That is sufficient." She walked forward with a monotonous pace, covering the short distance of ten or so meters, and soon stood right in front of Aurelius-Markus, her fingertip only a few centimeters from his forehead.

"And you?"

"I believe he is not correct."

The air around the girl suddenly grew heavy. The magical power in the atmosphere, along with all of her small source of magic, was insufficient and being consumed by some spell. She raised her eyes, contemplating the truth of the statement.

The scent of perfume made his nose itch, and Marlowe simply raised his right hand. "This is the evidence."

The tip of his little finger, with a faint flow of magic, was confined to a mere few millimeters. This was the beginning of the Marlowe family's magecraft circuit that he had inscribed.

Edelfelt took his little finger, gazing at it in a daze for a long while. Finally, she realized her lapse in composure, released his hand, and walked away.

Marlowe heard her voice behind him: "Do not forget the first principle."

If mystery becomes known to the world—known to everyone, it can no longer be called a mystery, and mystery will lose its power. Therefore, mystery should be concealed. And his teacher, Alan Newell, the head of Modern Magecraft Science and the founder of Magecraft Calculation, seemed to be violating this principle.

The date is July 15, 1992.

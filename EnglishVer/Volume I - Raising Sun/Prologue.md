"Arise, beautiful sun, and obliterate that jealous moon."

— _Romeo and Juliet_, Act II, Scene II

"Your teacher is an enemy of magecraft."

Aurelius-Markus Marlowe paused and looked towards the source of the voice. His gaze swept over a row of exquisite artworks, complemented by intricate reliefs adorning an ordinary corridor. At the end of the corridor stood his classmate, Luvia Edelfelt, a well-dressed noblewoman from Northern Europe.

He met her indifferent gaze, waiting for her to continue.

"Your teacher is a great enemy of humanity."

Marlowe raised his hands in a surrender gesture. The two disjointed statements left him impatient to hear more, especially as he was about to be late in three minutes. "Great minds think alike," he said.

However, the girl's expression changed drastically. Magic light suddenly flared up in her hand as mysterious power flowed through her magecraft circuits and into the magical engraving in her arm. The atmosphere was disturbed, and the growing hum made him restless, his hairs standing on end.

He hadn't yet adjusted to these otherworldly experiences. However, his teacher had taught him that the research of long-standing magecraft families is often passed down in the form of magical engravings. These engravings regulate the flow of magic, producing various magecraft effects. The life’s work of each generation’s head is encapsulated in these engravings, which, though lighter than paper, are heavier than mountains.

Magecraft, relying on mystery as its power and secrecy as its principle, adheres to the fundamental rule here at the Clock Tower and throughout the magecraft world: "Mystery must be concealed." There are no other moral standards, nor any so-called laws. Historic magecraft families are like undefeated gladiators, and magecraft is their sharpest sword. Therefore, the head of the Edelfelt family, Luvia Edelfelt, wields something far beyond a mere paper cutter.

Moreover, isn't a paper cutter capable of murder? Don’t be misled by the name; magecraft, nearly miraculous, is not mere street performance tricks but a practical shortcut—a shortcut from cause to effect. What humans cannot achieve is called a miracle; everything else falls within the realm of magecraft. Since the death of the Mage King Solomon nearly three thousand years ago, the surviving magicians from brutal struggles are no easy adversaries.

Today's conflict is, at most, a war of words, but if nothing is done, the former classmate would probably not mind adding another unmarked grave on the outskirts of London. The other side of the world is indeed fraught with danger.

These thoughts crossed his mind in a moment, and he saw the aristocratic girl growing more enraged.

"However, if I said I fully agreed, that would be a lie."

The magecraft Luvia excels at is "curse bullets." Normally, they might only make someone ill, but through her magical engraving, they can cause instantaneous heart failure and death.

"Do you have any final words?"

The young man paused.

"He is not an enemy of humanity, just an enemy of the nobility."

The wind stopped for a moment, and Edelfelt released her grip. "That is sufficient." She walked forward with a monotonous pace, covering the short distance of ten or so meters, and soon stood right in front of Aurelius-Markus, her fingertip only a few centimeters from his forehead.

"And you?"

"I believe he is not correct."

The air around the girl suddenly grew heavy. The magical power in the atmosphere, along with all of her small source of magic, was insufficient and being consumed by some spell. She raised her eyes, contemplating the truth of the statement.

The scent of perfume made his nose itch, and Marlowe simply raised his right hand. "This is the evidence."

The tip of his little finger, with a faint flow of magic, was confined to a mere few millimeters. This was the beginning of the Marlowe family's magecraft circuit that he had inscribed.

Edelfelt took his little finger, gazing at it in a daze for a long while. Finally, she realized her lapse in composure, released his hand, and walked away.

Marlowe heard her voice behind him: "Do not forget the first principle."

If mystery becomes known to the world—known to everyone, it can no longer be called a mystery, and mystery will lose its power. Therefore, mystery should be concealed. And his teacher, Alan Newell, the head of Modern Magecraft Science and the founder of Magecraft Calculation, seemed to be violating this principle.
